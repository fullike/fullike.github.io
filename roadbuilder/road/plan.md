You can adjust the curvature of each control point, and control the curvature gradient via the CurvatureBlend parameter.

{: .note }
Variable curvature is generally used for the transition from straight roads to curved roads. CurvatureBlend parameter controls the ratio of variable curvature to fixed curvature, with 0 representing the entire section of road being fixed curvature, 1 representing the entire section of road being variable curvature, and 0.5 being half each.

## Road style
<br>
