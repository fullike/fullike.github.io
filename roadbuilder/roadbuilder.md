# RoadBuilder

RoadBuilder is a plugin for UnrealEngine that helps you make complex roads in the Unreal Editor.

RoadBuilder allows you to edit every detail of your road, including lane type, width, lane markings, traffic signs, zebra crossings, and more, while its built-in road styles allow you to quickly create various types of roads, such as street, highway, ramps, and more.

The roads created by RoadBuilder can be exported to HDMap formats such as xodr for use in various autonomous driving simulation environments, and can also be easily combined with various PCG systems to generate complex city-style game maps
